# 1.0 Install/Uninstall

1. Installation follows the usual XOOPS routine. After downloading the module distribution pack, decompress the file and open the folder and any nested folder beneath until you find the main module files. The parent folder will be uploaded to your server into the 'Modules' directory. Now open and view the  'Readme' or changelog files and follow any directions given. There are no pre-install configurations required for this module. <br><br>  
2. Using your usual FTP client upload the smartfaq directory to you 'modules' directory of your website files.<br> <br> 
3. Open your website administration page and go to 'modules'<br> <br> 
4. Install the module by clicking the install link. A confirmation page should give you a link back to 'module administration page'
 
5. **Permission changes:** If the default mail templates used by the xHelp
module will be modified, the directory:

    ***modules/xhelp/language/english/mail_templates*** 

    will need to be made writable.
