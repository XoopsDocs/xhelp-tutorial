# 5.0 The User Side

The xhelp system was designed with simplicity in mind. It is very easy to submit a ticket and manage the responses, notifications, and status’.

This section is broken down into two sub-sections. The first, “Using xhelp”
describes how to use the xhelp system from a user standpoint, the second ,
“Managing xhelp Tickets”, describes managing tickets submitted by users.

#### Using xhelp (user access)

The xhelp module allows users to submit, and view the status of any ticket they
have submitted. When a user accesses the xhelp module, three areas are
available:

**Main**

The **Main** area is the default screen that appears when a user accesses the xhelp
module. This area displays any tickets that have not been closed by a staff
member. The user can view activity such as answers and responses sent by the
staff, and reopen tickets if the Preference configuration has been set to allow this action.

**Log Ticket**

The **Log Ticket** area is where a user can submit an xhelp ticket. Once a ticket has been submitted, it is considered an “open” status. The department the ticket was submitted to will be notified.

submitted, the department staff and the user will be notified.

#### Staff Access xhelp Overview

The xhelp module allows Staff and Department Members to view the status of any
ticket submitted to a department where they have been assigned membership.
This section assumes the Department Member has full administrative rights to the xhelp module.

**Staff Access xhelp Navigation**

When a staff member enters the xhelp section. The following areas are available:

**Main**

The **Main** area is the default screen that appears when a staff member accesses the xhelp module. This area displays new tickets, tickets that have not yet been assigned to a staff member, and tickets assigned to the currently logged on staff member.

Configuration options also allow the staff member to set refresh preferences and perform word searches for tickets.

| Staff Access | Ticket Tables |
| -- | -- |
| **Priority Unassigned Tickets** | This table displays help requests that have have not yet been processed or assigned to a staff member. Only tickets with a high priority will be shown here. |
| **New Tickets** |This table shows tickets that have been submitted, but not yet been assigned to a staff member for processing. All tickets will appear here regardless of the priority. |
| **Open Tickets Assigned To Me** | This table shows tickets that the user has taken ownership of, or been assigned to. |


**Log Ticket**

The **Log Ticket** area is where a user or staff member submit an xhelp ticket.
Once a ticket has been submitted, it is considered an “open” status. The
department the ticket was submitted to will be notified. The Log Ticket area
works the same way for “Users” and Staff members.

**My Profile**

The **My Profile** area is used to check the logged in staff members performance
and rating reviews. This area is also where “Pre-Defined” responses can be
created and inserted into a reply to a submitted ticket. At this time, only one
response template can be used per response.

| **Update Priority** | The ticket priority can be adjusted  |
| **Update Status** | The status can be updated. A ticket can be closed from this menu. |

**Ticket Details**

The ticket details displays any responses that have been made, a history of
actions that have taken place since the ticket was opened, and other tickets that have been opened by the user. Additional notification options can also be set.

history

#### Managing xhelp Tickets

When a user, or another staff member submits a ticket, it will be sent to a
Department, where the department lead or members can assign, take ownership,
respond, edit, delete, and/or print the ticket.

**Assigning And Taking Ticket Ownership**

Although once a ticket is submitted, any action can take place, it is best to first claim the ticket, or assign it to another staff member.
